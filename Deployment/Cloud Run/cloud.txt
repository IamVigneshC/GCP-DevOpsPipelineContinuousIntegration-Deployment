Cloud Run simplifies and automates deployments to Kubernetes. 
When you use Cloud Run, you don't need a configuration file. 
You simply choose a cluster for your application. 
With Cloud Run, you can use a cluster managed by Google, or you can use your own Kubernetes cluster. 
To use Cloud Run, your application needs to be deployed using a Docker image and it must be stateless.
